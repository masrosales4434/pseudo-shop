# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1:
- Student 2:

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
_(Who worked on which features? How was the work assigned or negotiated?)_

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
_(E.g., branching, rebasing, frequent commits, etc.)_

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
_(Include any lessons learned or techniques used to resolve the issue.)_

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
_The ambiguity of the instructions for features 1 and 4 was the biggest challenge we faced as a team. We were overthinking on the filters. Our thought process were aligned, however, we found the two features, or maybe the terms used, to be conflicting. Despite that, we agreed to keep the implementation of the filters as how it actually works in real life. So if a filter is applied, it would still display the other attributes as long as the filter applied actually matches an attribute._

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
_Branching is important when working with multple features assigned to different members of a team. It provides clarity and minimizes any conflicts that may occur. It does have a slight learning curve, having to always monitor changes of the team and keeping local codes updated to avoid merge conflicts. It is also very important to keep communication lines open when collaborating to have proper brainstorming and yield good results._

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
_A more efficient and detailed planning before working on the actual code would have been great, but communicating while working was also effective._

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
_It was a good simulation and very close to how we work as a group in school projects. It was our first time using fork and we found it really fascinating and useful. There was a tricky part in creating a pull request which sets the comparison with the actual base repository, but resolving it was pretty simple._
